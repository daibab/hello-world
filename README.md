# hello-world
This is my first experience on Git-hub
Now, I was asked to write a bit about myself and I'm doing that. I'm thinking about what to write, but I don't know, or myabe I know, cause I already wrote something, but it't not about myself. Here we go ;)

I think this is a good idea. Afarm rola
